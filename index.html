        <h1>Project Team 13: Topic: Worldwide Deaths, COSI 116A F23</h1>

        <p><strong>Mackenzie Chung</strong>, <strong>Debbie Engelberg</strong>, <strong>Noam
            Reiner</strong>, <strong>Cameron Sherman</strong></p>

        <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
            href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
            University</a>.</p>

        <h1>Motivation</h1>

        <p>Alcohol consumption is a significant global health concern, often cited as a leading risk factor for
          numerous medical conditions and social issues. From a young age, we are taught about the dangers of
          excessive drinking and its potential to lead to addiction, liver disease, mental health disorders, and even
          premature death. Yet, the true scope of its impact on global mortality and its comparison to other leading
          causes of death is often less understood. This gap in understanding inspired our team to delve deeper into
          the correlation between alcohol consumption and death rates worldwide.

        </p>

        <p>We set out to answer critical questions: How does alcohol-related mortality compare to other common
          causes of death? Is the narrative around alcohol consumption's dangers as dire as parents and educators
          suggest? Additionally, how do these risks vary across different countries and over time? To address these
          questions, we created a series of visualizations aimed at individuals of all backgrounds who are
          curious about the broader effects of alcohol consumption.

        </p>

        <p>
          Our visualizations allow users to explore data on alcohol consumption, death rates, birth rates, and causes
          of death interactively. Users can observe patterns across different years and regions, enabling them to draw
          informed conclusions. Through this experience, we hope to provide valuable insights into the complex and
          often overlooked impact of alcohol on global health.
        </p>

          <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

          <p><em>There are 3 different visualizations that users can explore which are all found under the drop-down menu
              for "Visualizations."</em></p>
          <p>
          <h3>Brushing & Linking </h3>
          <em>
            In this visualization, users can observe how alcohol consumption rate (per capita) compares to the number
            of deaths documented in each country through a slider and two graphs below: A linchart that shows the deathrate
            across the years, and a bar graph that shows the total alcohol consumption rate across the years. Points that are highlighted 
            in the linechart will be reflected in the bargraph and vice versa. Users can play the slider to which it will go through
            the data for all the available years (2000 to 2019) and the graphs below will highlight each point and bar for the current year
            it is being iterated through. Users can also manually drag the slider to compare with specific graphs.

          <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
          <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

          <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be
              very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

          <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

          <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

          <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain
              problems.</em></p>

          <h1>Design Process</h1>

          <p><em>Each team member drafted 2 ideas to contribute, and as a team, we went through all our ideas and chose
              our top 3 visualizations. After drawing them out more precisely, we decided to incorporate all 3 options
              into our final project. While working on the visualizations, we've encountered a lot of difficulties with using
              the D3 library, but eventually figured out how to code out bits and parts of our visualizations.
