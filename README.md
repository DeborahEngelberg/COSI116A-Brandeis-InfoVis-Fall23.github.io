### Project's Primary Purpose

Our project focuses on visualizing and analyzing how alcohol consumption rates across various countries influence death rates, comparing these impacts to other leading causes of death over multiple years. By highlighting the relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality, this project aims to support healthcare professionals and prevention practitioners in reducing drinking-related risks, offering valuable data to observe and compare global trends.

# <ins> Step 1 - Brainsotrming Ideas  and Looking for Data</ins>

As a group, we quickly decided that we wanted to implement a map visualization in our final project. Our initial idea was to show different types of transportation and their frequencies around the world. However, as we began searching for data, we quickly realized that it was very difficult to find free, accurate transportation data. As a result, we shifted our focus to another type of global data. While researching, we discovered data related to alcohol consumption and causes of death, and we became curious about whether there might be a correlation between the two. This led us to combine these two data sets for our final project.
